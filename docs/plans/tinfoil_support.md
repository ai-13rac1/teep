# Plan: Tinfoil Provider Support

## Overview

Add Tinfoil as a teep provider with full attestation verification and E2EE
support. Tinfoil runs OpenAI-compatible inference in secure enclaves
(TDX and SEV-SNP). Attestation is fetched from a well-known HTTP endpoint on
the enclave, verified against hardware roots of trust and Sigstore supply-chain
attestations, and bound to TLS via the enclave's certificate fingerprint. E2EE
uses the EHBP protocol (HPKE-based full-body encryption).

Reference providers for implementation patterns: **nearcloud**, **neardirect**,
**chutes**.

## Provider Characteristics

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Name | `tinfoil` |
| Base URL | `https://inference.tinfoil.sh` |
| API key env | `TINFOIL_API_KEY` |
| E2EE | Yes (EHBP: HPKE + AES-256-GCM full-body encryption) |
| Connection model | Standard TLS with SPKI pinning (not connection-pinned) |
| Attestation endpoint | `GET /.well-known/tinfoil-attestation` on the enclave |
| Nonce model | V2: No client nonces (keys embedded in attestation). V3: Client nonce via `?nonce=<hex>` query parameter. |
| PinnedHandler | No — uses standard HTTP client with SPKI verification |
| Supply chain | Sigstore DSSE bundles from GitHub attestations API |
| Hardware platforms | Intel TDX and AMD SEV-SNP (multi-platform code measurements) |
| GPU support | NVIDIA H100/H200 (Hopper), Blackwell; 1-GPU and 8-GPU (HGX) configurations |
| GPU attestation | SPDM via NVML; boot-time fail-closed; V3 binds GPU evidence to CPU quote |
| TEE.fail mitigation | None (same as all current TDX providers) |

## Supported Endpoints

| Endpoint | Upstream Path | E2EE | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Chat completions | `/v1/chat/completions` | Yes (EHBP) | Multiple models: llama3-3-70b, gemma4-31b, glm-5-1, gpt-oss-120b, kimi-k2-5, etc. |
| Embeddings | `/v1/embeddings` | Yes (EHBP) | Model: nomic-embed-text |
| Audio transcriptions | `/v1/audio/transcriptions` | Yes (EHBP) | Models: whisper-large-v3-turbo, voxtral-small-24b. Multipart form data. |
| TTS (text-to-speech) | `/v1/audio/speech` | Yes (EHBP) | Models: qwen3-tts, whisper-large-v3-turbo |
| Models list | `/v1/models` | No | GET request; EHBP only encrypts bodies on POST requests |

Vision models (qwen3-vl-30b, gemma4-31b, kimi-k2-5) use the chat completions
endpoint with multimodal content arrays — no separate vision endpoint is needed.

Note: EHBP encrypts the entire HTTP body as a single AEAD stream. There are
**no field-level gaps**. All request and response fields are encrypted by
construction, like Chutes.

## Architecture Comparison with Existing Providers

### Similarities to Chutes

- Full-body encryption (no field-level dispatch needed)
- Standard TLS (not connection-pinned like neardirect/nearcloud)
- No client-supplied nonces in attestation
- No PinnedHandler needed
- TDX attestation verification reuses `attestation.VerifyTDXQuote()`

### Key Differences from All Existing Providers

1. **Attestation format**: Tinfoil uses its own format — a JSON object with
   `format` (predicate type URI) and `body` (base64-gzipped hardware quote).
   Not dstack, not chutes, not NEAR.
2. **Supply chain**: Sigstore verification of GitHub Actions build attestations
   (DSSE in-toto bundles), checked against code image digests published in
   GitHub Releases. This is independent of the compose-hash / IMA supply chain
   used by other providers.
3. **REPORTDATA binding**: `ReportData[0:32]` = SHA-256 of TLS public key
   (PKIX DER encoding); `ReportData[32:64]` = 32-byte HPKE public key. No
   nonce or signing address in REPORTDATA.
4. **E2EE protocol**: EHBP (RFC 9180 HPKE + AES-256-GCM), not
   Ed25519/XChaCha20-Poly1305 or ML-KEM-768/ChaCha20-Poly1305.
5. **HPKE key from attestation**: HPKE X25519 public key is embedded in
   REPORTDATA[32:64] and verified as part of attestation. The cipher suite
   is fixed (X25519_HKDF_SHA256 / HKDF_SHA256 / AES_256_GCM) per the EHBP
   spec, so no key config endpoint is needed.
6. **Hardware measurement verification**: TDX hardware platforms (MRTD, RTMR0)
   matched against a separate Sigstore-attested hardware measurements registry
   (`tinfoilsh/hardware-measurements`).
7. **Multi-platform code measurements**: Code attestation uses a unified
   `snp-tdx-multiplatform/v1` predicate that cross-matches SEV-SNP and TDX
   measurements from a single Sigstore bundle.
8. **SEV-SNP support**: Tinfoil enclaves can run on AMD SEV-SNP (not just TDX).
   The attestation format field determines which hardware verification path to
   take.
9. **GPU attestation binding (V3)**: Tinfoil is the first provider that
   actually implements GPU evidence hash in REPORTDATA (Option 2 from
   gpu_cpu_binding.md). GPU SPDM evidence and NVSwitch evidence are
   hash-bound into the CPU quote. Boot-time GPU attestation is fail-closed.
10. **No TEE.fail mitigations**: Like all current providers, Tinfoil has no
    Proof of Cloud participation, no vTPM, and no DCEA. TEE.fail is an open
    vulnerability. See "Authentication Chain 5" for full analysis.

## Authentication Chain Analysis

This section documents the complete authentication chains from hardware root
of trust through to the user's plaintext, explicitly comparing Tinfoil's
model against the gaps documented in `docs/attestation_gaps/dstack_integrity.md`
and `docs/attestation_gaps/model_weights.md`. The code agent must enforce every
link in these chains.

### Gap Comparison: Tinfoil vs. Dstack Providers

The dstack integrity gap (dstack_integrity.md) identifies that dstack-based
providers (Venice, Nearcloud, Neardirect) suffer from an **in-band discovery
gap**: the boot-chain registers MRTD, RTMR0–RTMR2 must be compared against
externally-sourced expected values, but no provider publishes those values in
a signed, machine-readable format. Operators must manually maintain measurement
allowlists, and provider infrastructure changes silently break verification.

The model weights gap (model_weights.md) documents that no dstack provider
includes model identity in the attestation chain. The Docker Compose manifest
binds the container image, but model weights are downloaded at runtime inside
the container — the attestation proves the correct software, not the correct
model.

**Tinfoil closes both gaps by design:**

1. **Boot-chain measurements are published in Sigstore.** Tinfoil's
   `pri-build-action` GitHub Actions workflow computes expected measurements
   for every deployment configuration and publishes them as a signed Sigstore
   bundle in the transparency log. Teep fetches the bundle and compares its
   measurement predicates against the hardware attestation report. There are
   no operator-maintained allowlists — the expected values are authenticated
   and machine-readable.

2. **Model weights are attested via dm-verity + Sigstore.** Tinfoil uses a
   tool called `modelwrap` to create a read-only volume containing model
   weights and compute a cryptographic commitment (dm-verity root hash) over
   it. This commitment is pinned in `tinfoil-config.yml`, whose SHA-256 hash
   is embedded in the kernel command line (measured into the attestation
   report). At runtime, the CVM mounts the model volume read-only and
   dm-verity validates every block read against the Merkle tree root hash.
   Any tampered block causes an I/O error. The `tinfoil-config.yml` and its
   model commitment are covered by the Sigstore bundle, so teep can verify
   that the model weights running in the enclave are exactly what was
   committed at build time.

3. **All disks are read-only and stateless.** The CVM mounts all virtual
   disks read-only and uses ramdisk for ephemeral data. There is no
   persistent writable state between boots. This eliminates the runtime
   weight substitution vector that model_weights.md identifies for dstack
   providers, where the inference engine could download alternative weights.

4. **Configuration is measured into the attestation.** The
   `tinfoil-config.yml` file (containing the model commitment, container
   images, CVM version, and resource allocation) has its SHA-256 embedded in
   the kernel command line. Since the kernel command line is measured into
   RTMR2 (TDX) or the launch measurement (SEV-SNP), any change to the
   configuration produces a different attestation that will not match the
   Sigstore bundle.

5. **No per-deployment-class variation.** Unlike dstack, where RTMR0 varies
   with CPU/RAM/GPU count and operators must pin multiple values, Tinfoil's
   Sigstore bundle is scoped to a specific deployment configuration. The
   bundle contains the exact expected measurements for that configuration.
   If Tinfoil changes the hardware profile, a new Sigstore bundle is
   published.

| Gap | Dstack Providers | Tinfoil |
|---|---|---|
| Boot-chain register discovery | Out-of-band, operator-maintained | In-band via Sigstore bundle |
| MRSEAM / firmware identity | Derivable from Intel, needs manual pin | Published in Sigstore bundle |
| MRTD / CVM image identity | Derivable from dstack build, needs manual pin | Published in Sigstore bundle |
| RTMR0 / hardware config | Per-deployment-class, no signed publication | Published in Sigstore bundle |
| RTMR1-2 / kernel+rootfs | Per-image build, no signed publication | Published in Sigstore bundle |
| Model weight authentication | Not attested (downloaded at runtime) | dm-verity root hash in attested config |
| Model identity in attestation | Not present | config.yml commitment → kernel cmdline → RTMR2 |
| Configuration authenticity | Compose hash in MRCONFIGID | config.yml hash in kernel cmdline + Sigstore |
| Measurement baseline maintenance | Manual operator burden | Automated via Sigstore transparency log |
| GPU attestation (boot-time) | Not enforced at boot | nvattest + SPDM verified at boot; fail-closed |
| GPU-CPU binding | Not implemented (`cpu_gpu_chain` = Fail) | GPU evidence hash in V3 REPORTDATA (Option 2) |
| GPU topology validation | Not validated | 8-GPU + 4-NVSwitch PPCIe mesh validated at boot |
| TEE.fail defense | Proof of Cloud (conditional) | None (same vulnerability) |
| vTPM / DCEA | Not implemented | Not implemented |

### Authentication Chain 1: CVM Environment (Hardware → Code)

This chain proves that the enclave is running the expected firmware, kernel,
and application code on genuine hardware. Every link must be verified; a
break at any point means the enclave identity is unproven.

```

**What teep must verify (enforcement checklist):**

1. Validate hardware attestation report signature against manufacturer cert
   chain (AMD ARK→ASK→VCEK or Intel root→PCK→QE). → `tee_quote_structure`
2. Compare all measurement registers against values from Sigstore bundle:
   - TDX: MRTD, RTMR0, RTMR1, RTMR2 against multi-platform predicate
   - SEV-SNP: launch measurement against snp_measurement
   → `sigstore_code_verified`
3. Verify Sigstore bundle: DSSE signature, Fulcio certificate, SCT,
   transparency log entry, observer timestamp. → `sigstore_code_verified`
4. Apply platform-specific policy checks:
   - TDX: TD_ATTRIBUTES, XFAM, MR_SEAM whitelist, RTMR3==0, zero fields
   - SEV-SNP: guest policy (Debug=false, SMT, etc.), TCB minimums
   → `tee_hardware_config`
5. Match TDX MRTD + RTMR0 against hardware measurements registry.
   → `cpu_id_registry`
6. Verify RTMR3 is all zeros (no unexpected runtime extensions).

### Authentication Chain 2: Encryption Keys (Hardware → Plaintext)

This chain proves that only the attested enclave can decrypt user data. Every
link must hold; a break means an intermediary could read plaintext.

```
Link 1: Key Generation Inside Enclave
│   At boot, enclave generates:
│     - ECDSA key pair for TLS (private key in encrypted memory)
│     - X25519 key pair for HPKE/EHBP (private key in encrypted memory)
│   Private keys never leave enclave memory.
│   Destroyed when enclave terminates (stateless CVM).
│
├── Link 2: Key Binding to Attestation
│   │   V2: REPORTDATA[0:31] = SHA-256(TLS public key, PKIX DER)
│   │       REPORTDATA[32:63] = HPKE X25519 public key (raw 32 bytes)
│   │   V3: REPORTDATA[0:31] = SHA-256(TLS FP || HPKE key || nonce || GPU hash || NVSwitch hash)
│   │       REPORTDATA[32:63] = zeros
│   │       (GPU and NVSwitch evidence hashes bind GPU attestation to CPU quote)
│   │   REPORTDATA is part of the hardware-signed attestation report.
│   │   Verified by: extracting REPORTDATA from verified quote.
│   │
│   ├── Link 3: TLS Key Binding
│   │   │   Client connects to enclave via TLS.
│   │   │   Computes SHA-256 of server's TLS public key (PKIX DER).
│   │   │   Constant-time compares against REPORTDATA[0:31].
│   │   │   Mismatch → reject connection (fail closed).
│   │   │   Guarantees: TLS terminates inside the attested enclave.
│   │   │   No intermediary can MITM or terminate TLS.
│   │   │
│   │   └── Link 3a: TLS-Bound Transport (teep implementation)
│   │           Custom http.Transport with VerifyPeerCertificate callback
│   │           Checks SPKI fingerprint on every connection
│   │           Re-attestation on fingerprint mismatch
│   │           Connection: close on attestation boundary
│   │
│   └── Link 4: HPKE Key Binding
│       │   HPKE public key from REPORTDATA[32:63].
│       │   Used as the recipient public key for EHBP encryption.
│       │   Since it is part of the hardware-signed REPORTDATA, the key
│       │   is authenticated by the same hardware root of trust as the
│       │   CVM identity. No separate key endpoint needed.
│       │
│       ├── Link 5: EHBP Request Encryption
│       │   │   Client calls HPKE SetupBaseS with attested public key.
│       │   │   Request body encrypted as chunked AES-256-GCM stream.
│       │   │   Ehbp-Encapsulated-Key header sent to server.
│       │   │   Only the enclave holding the HPKE private key can decrypt.
│       │   │
│       │   └── Link 5a: Request Confidentiality
│       │           HTTP headers (routing, auth) visible to intermediaries.
│       │           Body (user prompts, data) encrypted end-to-end.
│       │           No plaintext fallback. Missing encryption → fail closed.
│       │
│       └── Link 6: EHBP Response Decryption
│           │   Server returns Ehbp-Response-Nonce header.
│           │   Client derives response key from HPKE context + nonce
│           │   (OHTTP/RFC 9458 key derivation).
│           │   Response body decrypted as chunked AES-256-GCM stream.
│           │
│           ├── Link 6a: Response Authenticity
│           │       AEAD tag on every chunk proves the response came from
│           │       the holder of the HPKE private key (the enclave).
│           │       Corrupted or forged chunks → decryption failure → fail closed.
│           │
│           └── Link 6b: Missing Nonce = Fail Closed
│                   If Ehbp-Response-Nonce header is absent, the response
│                   cannot be authenticated. Treat as unverified. Reject.
```

**What teep must verify (enforcement checklist):**

1. Extract TLS public key fingerprint from REPORTDATA[0:31] of the verified
   attestation report. → `tls_key_binding`
2. On every TLS connection to the enclave, compute SHA-256 of the server's
   PKIX-encoded public key and constant-time compare against the attested
   fingerprint. Mismatch → re-attest → mismatch again → block.
   → `tls_key_binding`
3. Extract HPKE public key from REPORTDATA[32:63] of the verified attestation
   report. → `e2ee_capable`
4. Use **only** this attested HPKE key for EHBP encryption. Never accept a
   key from any other source. The cipher suite is fixed:
   X25519_HKDF_SHA256 / HKDF_SHA256 / AES_256_GCM. → `e2ee_capable`
5. Encrypt every request body via EHBP before sending. No plaintext POST
   requests. → `e2ee_usable`
6. Require `Ehbp-Response-Nonce` header on every response. If absent, fail
   closed. → `e2ee_usable`
7. Decrypt and AEAD-verify every response chunk. On any auth failure, abort
   the response. → `e2ee_usable`

### Authentication Chain 3: Enclave Chaining (Router → Model)

Tinfoil uses a confidential model router that forwards requests to
per-model inference enclaves. Each hop is independently attested and
encrypted.

```
Client (teep proxy)
  │
  │  1. Verify router attestation (Sigstore + hardware quote)
  │  2. TLS-bind to router's attested TLS key
  │  3. EHBP-encrypt request to router's attested HPKE key
  │
  ▼
Model Router Enclave (tinfoilsh/confidential-model-router)
  │
  │  4. Router verifies target model enclave's attestation
  │  5. Router TLS-binds to model enclave's attested TLS key
  │  6. Router EHBP-encrypts forwarded request to model enclave
  │
  ▼
Model Inference Enclave (e.g. tinfoilsh/confidential-nomic-embed-text)
  │
  │  7. Model enclave decrypts request
  │  8. Inference runs on dm-verity-attested model weights
  │  9. Response EHBP-encrypted back through chain
  │
  ▼
Client receives AEAD-authenticated response
```

**Implication for teep:** Teep verifies the **router** enclave only. The
router performs the second-hop verification internally, using the same
Sigstore + hardware attestation + TLS binding logic. This is documented by
Tinfoil at https://docs.tinfoil.sh/verification/verification-in-tinfoil
(section "Chaining enclaves"). Teep trusts the router's code to do this
correctly, which is justified because the router code itself is verified via
Sigstore supply chain attestation.

The router's Sigstore bundle attests the code that performs second-hop
verification. If the router code were modified to skip model enclave
verification, the code measurement would change and the Sigstore comparison
would fail. This makes the chain self-enforcing: teep verifies the router,
and the verified router code verifies the models.

### Authentication Chain 4: Model Weight Integrity

Unlike dstack providers where model weights are downloaded at runtime and
not covered by attestation, Tinfoil binds model weights into the attestation
chain through a combination of dm-verity and configuration pinning.

```
Sigstore Transparency Log
  │
  │  Contains: pri-build-action output with expected measurements
  │  Including: hash of tinfoil-config.yml
  │
  ▼
tinfoil-config.yml (committed to GitHub)
  │
  │  Contains: modelwrap dm-verity root hash for each model volume
  │  Contains: container image digests
  │  Contains: CVM version, resource allocation
  │  SHA-256 hash embedded in kernel command line
  │
  ▼
Kernel command line → measured into RTMR2 (TDX) / launch measurement (SEV-SNP)
  │
  │  At boot: CVM verifies config on disk matches attested hash
  │  Mismatch → boot aborts
  │
  ▼
dm-verity volume mount
  │
  │  Model weight volume mounted read-only
  │  dm-verity Merkle tree root hash from tinfoil-config.yml
  │  Every block read validated by kernel dm-verity subsystem
  │  Tampered block → I/O error → inference fails
  │
  ▼
vLLM loads model from verified volume
  │
  │  Volume is read-only; no runtime download possible
  │  All .safetensors shards validated block-by-block
  │
  ▼
Inference output from attested model weights
```

**What teep must verify (enforcement checklist):**

Teep does not directly verify dm-verity — that happens inside the CVM kernel.
Teep's role is to verify the chain that makes dm-verity trustworthy:

1. Verify the Sigstore bundle for the deployment repo (contains the
   measurements derived from the tinfoil-config.yml). → `sigstore_code_verified`
2. Compare attestation register values against the Sigstore bundle to confirm
   the CVM booted with the attested config (which pins the model dm-verity
   hash). → `sigstore_code_verified`
3. The `measured_model_weights` factor should be set to `Pass` for Tinfoil
   when `sigstore_code_verified` passes, because the Sigstore chain
   transitively authenticates the model weights via config.yml → dm-verity.
   Detail string should explain the transitive chain.

### Authentication Chain 5: GPU Attestation and CPU-GPU Binding

Tinfoil uses NVIDIA GPUs (Hopper H100/H200, Blackwell) with NVIDIA
Confidential Computing. This section analyses Tinfoil's GPU attestation
model against the gaps documented in `docs/attestation_gaps/gpu_cpu_binding.md`.

#### What Tinfoil Implements

**Boot-time GPU attestation (fail-closed):**
- At CVM boot, the `nvattest` tool performs local NVIDIA GPU attestation
  (`nvattest attest --device gpu --verifier local`).
- SPDM reports are collected from each GPU and validated locally.
- For 8-GPU HGX systems: NVSwitch attestation and full PPCIe topology
  validation (8 GPUs + 4 NVSwitches mesh integrity) are also enforced.
- If GPU attestation fails, the CVM sets GPU ready state to
  `ACCEPTING_CLIENT_REQUESTS_FALSE` and boot aborts. **No enclave starts
  without passing GPU attestation.**

**Runtime GPU evidence collection:**
- The V3 attestation endpoint (`/.well-known/tinfoil-attestation?nonce=<hex>`)
  collects fresh SPDM evidence from all GPUs and NVSwitches.
- Evidence is collected via NVML APIs (`GetConfComputeGpuAttestationReport`)
  with the client-supplied nonce passed through to the GPU.
- GPU evidence is returned in the attestation response as `gpu` and
  `nvswitch` JSON fields alongside the CPU report.

**GPU evidence hash in REPORTDATA (V3 format):**
- For V3 attestation, REPORTDATA is computed as:
  ```
  REPORTDATA[0:32] = SHA-256(tls_key_fp || hpke_key || nonce || gpu_evidence_hash || nvswitch_evidence_hash)
  REPORTDATA[32:64] = zeros
  ```
  Where `gpu_evidence_hash = SHA-256(gpu_evidence_json)` and
  `nvswitch_evidence_hash = SHA-256(nvswitch_evidence_json)`.
- This cryptographically binds GPU evidence to the TDX/SEV-SNP CPU quote.
  The CPU hardware signs REPORTDATA, so the GPU evidence hash is
  hardware-authenticated.

**This implements Option 2 from gpu_cpu_binding.md** (GPU evidence hash in
TDX REPORTDATA). Tinfoil also extends it to include NVSwitch evidence.

#### V2 vs V3 Attestation Formats

Tinfoil serves two attestation formats from the same endpoint:

| Aspect | V2 (legacy, no nonce) | V3 (fresh, nonce-based) |
|---|---|---|
| Endpoint | `GET /.well-known/tinfoil-attestation` | `GET /.well-known/tinfoil-attestation?nonce=<64hex>` |
| REPORTDATA layout | `[0:32] SHA-256(TLS pubkey)` \| `[32:64] HPKE key` | `[0:32] SHA-256(tls_fp\|\|hpke\|\|nonce\|\|gpu_hash\|\|nvswitch_hash)` \| `[32:64] zeros` |
| GPU evidence | Not included | Included in response (`gpu`, `nvswitch` fields) |
| GPU binding | None | SHA-256 hash in REPORTDATA |
| Freshness | TLS key lifecycle | Client-supplied nonce |
| Signed by | TLS private key (ECDSA) | TLS private key (ECDSA) |
| Client verification | tinfoil-go verifier (existing) | Not yet verified by tinfoil-go |

**Important**: The tinfoil-go client library currently only verifies V2
attestation (no nonce, no GPU). The V3 format with GPU evidence binding
exists only on the CVM side. This means:
- Boot-time GPU attestation is enforced inside the CVM (fail-closed).
- GPU evidence is available in V3 responses but no client currently verifies it.

**Teep should implement V3 verification** to gain GPU binding, which also
provides client nonce freshness as a bonus. This is documented in the
implementation phases below.

#### Gap Analysis: GPU CPU Binding (gpu_cpu_binding.md)

| Issue from gpu_cpu_binding.md | Tinfoil Status | Details |
|---|---|---|
| **Gap 1: TEE.fail (TDX key extraction)** | **Unmitigated** | No Proof of Cloud, no vTPM, no DCEA. Same vulnerability as all TDX providers. |
| **Gap 2: CPU-to-GPU binding** | **Partially mitigated (V3 only)** | GPU evidence hash in REPORTDATA (Option 2). Only effective with V3 attestation. V2 has no GPU binding. |
| **GPU nonce freshness** | **Yes (V3 only)** | Client nonce passed through to GPU SPDM report in V3. Not applicable for V2. |
| **GPU topology validation** | **Yes (boot-time)** | 8-GPU + 4-NVSwitch mesh validation enforced at boot. |
| **vTPM / DCEA (Option 3)** | **Not implemented** | No vTPM in Tinfoil CVM image. |
| **TDX Connect / TDISP (Option 5)** | **Not implemented** | No silicon-level GPU binding. |
| **Proof of Cloud (Option 1)** | **Not implemented** | No hardware identity registry participation. |

#### TEE.fail Implications for Tinfoil

Tinfoil's security posture against TEE.fail is identical to other TDX
providers (NearAI, dstack): **no specific mitigation exists**. If an attacker
extracts TDX attestation signing keys via DDR5 memory bus interposition:

1. The attacker can forge TDX quotes with arbitrary REPORTDATA, including
   fabricated TLS key fingerprints and HPKE keys.
2. The attacker can forge measurement registers (MRTD, RTMRs) that match the
   Sigstore-expected values.
3. The Sigstore supply chain verification would pass (it only checks that
   measurements match — it cannot detect that the quote was forged).
4. E2EE would be defeated: the attacker's fabricated HPKE key would be
   accepted as the enclave's key.

For V3 attestation, the GPU evidence relay attack described in
gpu_cpu_binding.md applies: an attacker with extracted TDX keys can relay
real GPU evidence from the legitimate machine while fabricating the CPU quote
to bind their own keys. The GPU hash in REPORTDATA provides no defense when
the attacker controls REPORTDATA (via TEE.fail).

**Tinfoil-specific nuance**: Tinfoil's hermetically built CVM image is
stronger than dstack in one respect — if an attacker forges a TDX quote,
they must also provide a complete Tinfoil CVM environment (or intercept
connections), which is harder than with dstack where the attacker could run
arbitrary code. However, this is defense-in-obscurity, not a cryptographic
mitigation.

**What teep should do:**
1. Implement Tinfoil with the same `cpu_id_registry` and `cpu_gpu_chain`
   factors as other providers.
2. `cpu_id_registry`: Set to `Skip` for Tinfoil (no Proof of Cloud
   participation). If Tinfoil joins Proof of Cloud in the future, this can
   be upgraded.
3. `cpu_gpu_chain`:
   - V2 attestation: `Fail` (no GPU binding in REPORTDATA).
   - V3 attestation: `Pass` (GPU evidence hash verified in REPORTDATA).
4. Apply the same TEE.fail residual risk assessment as for other providers.
5. When DCEA/vTPM support becomes available, add verification support.

#### V3 REPORTDATA Verification (New for Teep)

For V3 attestation, the REPORTDATA verification is different from V2:

1. Recompute `gpu_evidence_hash = SHA-256(raw_gpu_json)` from the `gpu` field
   in the attestation response.
2. Recompute `nvswitch_evidence_hash = SHA-256(raw_nvswitch_json)` from the
   `nvswitch` field (if present; empty for single-GPU systems).
3. Recompute the expected REPORTDATA:
   ```
   expected[0:32] = SHA-256(tls_key_fp || hpke_key || nonce || gpu_evidence_hash || nvswitch_evidence_hash)
   expected[32:64] = zeros
   ```
4. Constant-time compare against the CPU quote's actual REPORTDATA.
5. Verify each GPU evidence SPDM report (nonce matches client nonce,
   certificate chain validates against NVIDIA root).
6. Verify the NVSwitch evidence likewise if present.

This gives teep three properties unavailable in V2:
- **GPU attestation binding**: GPU evidence is hardware-authenticated via CPU quote.
- **Client nonce freshness**: Nonce in REPORTDATA proves attestation is fresh.
- **NVSwitch topology**: NVSwitch evidence validates the GPU interconnect.

### Attestation Freshness Without Client Nonces

**V2 attestation** does not use client nonces. Freshness is established
through the TLS key lifecycle:

1. Each enclave boot generates a fresh TLS key pair and HPKE key pair.
2. The TLS key fingerprint is embedded in REPORTDATA and signed by hardware.
3. The TLS certificate is issued by a public CA and logged in CT logs.
4. When the enclave reboots, new keys are generated and a new attestation
   report is produced with different REPORTDATA.

**What teep must enforce:**

- **V3 attestation (preferred)**: Use client-supplied nonce in the query
  parameter. Verify the nonce is included in the REPORTDATA hash (see V3
  REPORTDATA verification in Authentication Chain 5). This provides
  cryptographic freshness equivalent to other providers.
- **V2 fallback**: On SPKI cache miss (new TLS certificate seen), trigger
  full re-attestation. On attestation, verify TLS key binding matches the
  current connection. The `nonce_in_reportdata` factor should be advisory
  for V2 attestation, with detail explaining the TLS-key-lifecycle freshness
  model.
- Do NOT treat the absence of a client nonce as a verification failure when
  using V2 attestation.

## Protocol Descriptions

### Tinfoil Attestation Protocol

#### Attestation Document Format

The enclave serves its attestation at `GET /.well-known/tinfoil-attestation`.
The response is a JSON object:

```json
{
  "format": "<predicate_type_uri>",
  "body": "<base64(gzip(hardware_attestation_report))>"
}
```

**Format values** (predicate type URIs):
- `https://tinfoil.sh/predicate/sev-snp-guest/v2` — AMD SEV-SNP attestation
- `https://tinfoil.sh/predicate/tdx-guest/v2` — Intel TDX attestation

The `body` field is base64 standard encoding of gzip-compressed raw hardware
attestation report bytes.

#### Decompression

1. Base64-decode the `body` string.
2. Gzip-decompress. Bound the decompressed size (10 MiB max) to prevent
   decompression bombs.
3. The result is a raw binary attestation report:
   - For TDX: a TDX QuoteV4 structure (min 1020 bytes).
   - For SEV-SNP: an SEV attestation report (1184 bytes).

#### REPORTDATA Layout (64 bytes)

Both TDX and SEV-SNP reports contain a 64-byte `report_data` field. The
layout depends on whether the attestation is V2 (legacy) or V3 (nonce-based).

**V2 REPORTDATA** (legacy, no nonce):

| Offset | Size | Content |
|---|---|---|
| 0–31 | 32 bytes | SHA-256 fingerprint of the enclave's TLS certificate public key (PKIX DER encoding) |
| 32–63 | 32 bytes | HPKE X25519 public key (raw 32 bytes) |

**V3 REPORTDATA** (nonce-based, includes GPU binding):

| Offset | Size | Content |
|---|---|---|
| 0–31 | 32 bytes | SHA-256(tls_key_fp \|\| hpke_key \|\| nonce \|\| gpu_evidence_hash \|\| nvswitch_evidence_hash) |
| 32–63 | 32 bytes | All zeros |

V3 attestation is returned when the client supplies a nonce query parameter.
It includes GPU evidence binding and client nonce freshness — see
"Authentication Chain 5: GPU Attestation and CPU-GPU Binding" for details.

Teep should use V3 attestation (with nonce) when available, falling back to
V2 only for compatibility. V3 provides strictly stronger properties.

### TDX Verification (Reuse Existing)

For TDX-format attestation, hex-encode the decompressed binary and call the
existing `attestation.VerifyTDXQuote()`. Extract measurements:

- Register 0: MRTD (48 bytes hex)
- Register 1: RTMR0 (48 bytes hex)
- Register 2: RTMR1 (48 bytes hex)
- Register 3: RTMR2 (48 bytes hex)
- Register 4: RTMR3 (48 bytes hex) — must be all zeros

#### TDX Additional Policy Checks (Tinfoil-Specific)

After the standard TDX quote verification, apply these additional checks:

1. **TD Attributes**: Must equal `0x0000001000000000` (SEPT_VE_DISABLE=1).
2. **XFAM**: Must equal `0xe702060000000000`.
3. **Minimum TEE TCB SVN**: Must be >= `0x03010200000000000000000000000000`.
4. **MR_SEAM**: Must be in the accepted firmware whitelist (see Measurement
   Policy section).
5. **MR_CONFIG_ID, MR_OWNER, MR_OWNER_CONFIG**: Must be all zeros.
6. **RTMR3**: Must be all zeros (96 hex chars of '0').

### SEV-SNP Verification (New)

For SEV-SNP-format attestation:

1. Parse the binary as an AMD SEV-SNP attestation report.
2. Fetch the VCEK certificate from AMD KDS (or cache). The AMD KDS can be
   accessed via the proxy at `kds-proxy.tinfoil.sh` or directly from AMD.
3. Verify the report signature against the VCEK cert chain (AMD Genoa root).
4. Validate guest policy:
   - SMT: true
   - Debug: false
   - SingleSocket: false
   - MinimumBuild: 21
   - MinimumVersion: 1.55
5. Validate TCB:
   - BlSpl >= 0x07
   - TeeSpl >= 0x00
   - SnpSpl >= 0x0e
   - UcodeSpl >= 0x48
6. Extract measurement: `report.Measurement` (single 48-byte hex register).

The SEV-SNP verification is new code — teep currently only verifies TDX
quotes. However, go-sev-guest (google/go-sev-guest) provides the verification
primitives, similar to how go-tdx-guest is used for TDX.

### Supply Chain Verification (Sigstore)

Tinfoil's supply chain verification uses GitHub Actions build attestations
verified through Sigstore.

#### Step 1: Fetch Code Image Digest

For a given configuration repo (e.g. `tinfoilsh/confidential-model-router`):

```
GET https://github-proxy.tinfoil.sh/repos/{repo}/releases/latest
```

Parse `tag_name` from the response. Then fetch the digest:

```
GET https://github-proxy.tinfoil.sh/repos/{repo}/releases/download/{tag}/tinfoil.hash
```

Returns a plain-text SHA-256 hex digest.

#### Step 2: Fetch Sigstore DSSE Bundle

```
GET https://github-proxy.tinfoil.sh/repos/{repo}/attestations/sha256:{digest}
```

Returns JSON with `attestations[0].bundle` containing a Sigstore DSSE
envelope.

#### Step 3: Verify Bundle

Verify the DSSE bundle using Sigstore's verification library:

- **OIDC issuer**: `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`
- **Workflow pattern**: `^https://github.com/{repo}/.github/workflows/.*@refs/tags/*`
- **Artifact digest**: Must match the `sha256:{digest}` from Step 1.
- **Require**: At least 1 signed certificate timestamp, 1 transparency log
  entry, 1 observer timestamp.

#### Step 4: Extract Code Measurements

The verified DSSE bundle contains an in-toto statement with a predicate. The
predicate type determines the measurement format:

- **`https://tinfoil.sh/predicate/snp-tdx-multiplatform/v1`**: Three registers:
  - Register 0: `snp_measurement` (SEV-SNP launch measurement)
  - Register 1: `tdx_measurement.rtmr1` (TDX RTMR1)
  - Register 2: `tdx_measurement.rtmr2` (TDX RTMR2)

#### Step 5: Compare Code vs. Enclave Measurements

Cross-platform comparison logic:

**Multi-platform code vs. TDX enclave:**
- Compare code register 1 (RTMR1) == enclave register 2 (RTMR1).
- Compare code register 2 (RTMR2) == enclave register 3 (RTMR2).
- Verify enclave register 4 (RTMR3) is all zeros.

**Multi-platform code vs. SEV-SNP enclave:**
- Compare code register 0 (snp_measurement) == enclave register 0 (measurement).

All comparisons MUST be constant-time (`subtle.ConstantTimeCompare`).

### Hardware Measurement Verification (TDX Only)

For TDX enclaves, verify that the hardware platform (MRTD, RTMR0) matches a
known trusted platform:

1. Fetch latest hardware measurements from
   `tinfoilsh/hardware-measurements` repo via GitHub Releases + Sigstore
   (same flow as code measurements above).
2. The predicate type is
   `https://tinfoil.sh/predicate/hardware-measurements/v1`.
3. Each entry has: `id` (platform identifier), `mrtd`, `rtmr0`.
4. Match the enclave's MRTD (register 0) and RTMR0 (register 1) against the
   hardware measurement entries.
5. If no match is found, the hardware platform is unknown — record as a
   verification factor failure.

### TLS Certificate Fingerprint Verification

After attestation verification:

1. Extract the TLS fingerprint from REPORTDATA bytes [0:32].
2. The proxy already has the upstream TLS certificate (from the HTTP
   connection).
3. Compute SHA-256 of the certificate's PKIX-encoded public key.
4. Constant-time compare the computed fingerprint with the attested
   fingerprint.
5. On mismatch: fail closed.

This binding ensures the TLS connection terminates inside the attested enclave.

### TLS-Fingerprint-Bound Transport

Tinfoil does not use a PinnedHandler (no in-band attestation on inference
connections). Instead, the proxy creates a **fingerprint-bound
`http.Transport`** that enforces the attested TLS identity on every
connection to the enclave.

Implementation pattern (similar to Tinfoil SDK's `TLSBoundRoundTripper`):

1. After attestation, extract the TLS SPKI fingerprint from
   REPORTDATA[0:32].
2. Create a custom `http.Transport` with a `VerifyPeerCertificate` callback:
   - Compute SHA-256 of the peer's PKIX-encoded public key.
   - Constant-time compare against the attested fingerprint.
   - On mismatch: return error (connection refused).
3. Set `DisableKeepAlives: false` — reuse TLS connections to the same
   enclave while the attestation is fresh.
4. Set `Connection: close` only when re-attestation is needed (attestation
   boundary).

**Re-attestation trigger**: When the SPKI cache entry expires or a TLS
handshake presents a new certificate fingerprint, the transport triggers
re-attestation before allowing any request through. On re-attestation:

1. Close existing connections (`Transport.CloseIdleConnections()`).
2. Fetch fresh attestation from `/.well-known/tinfoil-attestation`.
3. Verify the new attestation (full pipeline: TDX/SEV-SNP + supply chain).
4. Update the fingerprint in the transport's `VerifyPeerCertificate` callback.
5. Verify the HPKE key in the new REPORTDATA for E2EE continuity.

This approach avoids the overhead of per-request attestation while maintaining
the invariant that every byte transits a connection verified against an
attested enclave.

### E2EE: Encrypted HTTP Body Protocol (EHBP)

EHBP is documented at https://docs.tinfoil.sh/resources/ehbp and specified at
https://github.com/tinfoilsh/encrypted-http-body-protocol/blob/main/SPEC.md

The protocol encrypts entire HTTP request and response bodies using HPKE
(RFC 9180) while leaving headers in cleartext for routing.

#### HPKE Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| KEM | X25519_HKDF_SHA256 (0x0020) |
| KDF | HKDF_SHA256 (0x0001) |
| AEAD | AES_256_GCM (0x0002) |

#### Request Encryption

1. Use the HPKE public key from REPORTDATA[32:64] (already extracted and
   verified during attestation). The cipher suite is hardcoded:
   X25519_HKDF_SHA256 / HKDF_SHA256 / AES_256_GCM.
2. Establish an HPKE encryption context (`SetupBaseS`) using the server's
   public key and a fresh ephemeral keypair.
3. Encrypt the request body as a stream of length-prefixed chunks:
   - Each chunk: `[4-byte big-endian uint32 length] [AES-256-GCM ciphertext]`
   - Length counts ciphertext bytes only (not the 4-byte header).
   - AAD is empty. The HPKE sealer's internal nonce counter auto-increments.
   - Zero-length chunks may appear and should be skipped by receivers.
   - End of message is indicated by HTTP stream termination (no sentinel).
4. Set request header `Ehbp-Encapsulated-Key` to the lowercase hex encoding
   of the HPKE encapsulated key (32 bytes → 64 hex chars for X25519).
5. Use chunked transfer encoding; omit Content-Length.
6. Retain the HPKE sender context for response decryption.

#### Response Decryption

1. Read the `Ehbp-Response-Nonce` header (lowercase hex, 64 chars = 32 bytes).
   If absent, fail closed — do not treat the response as authenticated.
2. Derive response keys (following OHTTP / RFC 9458):
   ```
   secret = context.Export("ehbp response", 32)
   salt = concat(encapsulated_key, response_nonce)
   prk = HKDF-Extract(salt, secret)
   aead_key = HKDF-Expand(prk, "key", 32)    // AES-256 key
   aead_nonce = HKDF-Expand(prk, "nonce", 12) // GCM nonce
   ```
3. Decrypt response body chunks:
   - Same framing as request: `[4-byte length] [ciphertext]`.
   - Each chunk decrypted with AES-256-GCM using `aead_key`.
   - Nonce for chunk `i` (zero-indexed): `aead_nonce XOR i`.
   - AAD is empty.
4. On any decryption failure: fail closed, abort the response.

#### Bodyless Requests (GET /v1/models)

EHBP does not encrypt responses for bodyless requests (GET, HEAD, DELETE,
OPTIONS without a body). The `/v1/models` endpoint is a GET request, so it
transits in plaintext over the TLS connection pinned to the attested enclave.
This is acceptable because the models list is not user data.

#### Audio Transcription (Multipart)

For `/v1/audio/transcriptions`, the request body is `multipart/form-data`.
EHBP encrypts the entire multipart body as-is — the server middleware
decrypts it and reconstructs the multipart stream before passing to the
inference handler.

---

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Attestation Document Parsing and Verification

**Goal**: Fetch and verify Tinfoil attestation documents (TDX path only;
SEV-SNP deferred to Phase 3).

**Files to create**:
- `internal/provider/tinfoil/tinfoil.go` — Attester and Preparer
- `internal/provider/tinfoil/attestation.go` — Attestation document parsing
- `internal/provider/tinfoil/reportdata.go` — REPORTDATA verifier
- `internal/provider/tinfoil/policy.go` — TDX additional policy checks +
  MR_SEAM whitelist

**Implementation**:

1. **Attester** (`tinfoil.NewAttester(baseURL, apiKey, offline)`):
   - `FetchAttestation(ctx, model, nonce)` fetches
     `GET {baseURL}/.well-known/tinfoil-attestation`.
   - **V3 attestation (preferred)**: If nonce is available, append
     `?nonce=<hex>` query parameter (32 bytes → 64 hex chars). The response
     will include GPU/NVSwitch evidence and nonce-bound REPORTDATA.
   - **V2 fallback**: If no nonce is available, fetch without query parameter.
     The response uses legacy REPORTDATA layout (no GPU binding, no nonce).
   - Parse the JSON response. For V3, the response is:
     ```json
     {
       "format": "<attestation_format_v3_uri>",
       "report_data": { "tls_key_fp": "...", "hpke_key": "...", "nonce": "...",
                         "gpu_evidence_hash": "...", "nvswitch_evidence_hash": "..." },
       "cpu": { "platform": "tdx|sev-snp", "report": "<base64>" },
       "gpu": { "evidences": [...] },
       "nvswitch": { "evidences": [...] },
       "certificate": "<PEM>",
       "signature": "<base64 ECDSA>"
     }
     ```
     For V2, the response is `{ "format": "...", "body": "<base64(gzip(report))>" }`.
   - Detect V2 vs V3 by the presence of the `report_data` field (V3) or
     `body` field (V2).
   - Reject unknown format URIs — only accept known predicate type URIs.
   - **V3 parsing**: Base64-decode `cpu.report`, bound size to 10 MiB.
   - **V2 parsing**: Base64-decode and gzip-decompress `body`, bound
     decompressed size to 10 MiB.
   - For TDX: hex-encode the binary, set `raw.IntelQuote`.
   - Set `raw.BackendFormat = attestation.FormatTinfoil`.
   - **V2**: Extract REPORTDATA from the parsed quote: `raw.TLSFingerprint` =
     hex(REPORTDATA[0:32]). Store HPKE key from REPORTDATA[32:64].
   - **V3**: Extract `tls_key_fp` and `hpke_key` from `report_data` fields.
     Store GPU evidence JSON for later REPORTDATA verification and GPU
     attestation validation.
   - Store the HPKE public key via `raw.SigningKey` (hex-encoded). EHBP
     cipher suite is hardcoded — no key config fetch needed.
   - The `nonce` parameter is stored in the RawAttestation for report
     building.

2. **REPORTDATA Verifier** (`tinfoil.ReportDataVerifier{}`):
   - `VerifyReportData(reportData [64]byte, raw, nonce)`:
     - **V2 attestation** (no nonce in response, no GPU evidence):
       - Extract `tlsFP = hex(reportData[0:32])`.
       - Extract `hpkeKey = hex(reportData[32:64])`.
       - Verify `tlsFP` matches `raw.TLSFingerprint` (constant-time).
       - Return detail string: `"v2: tls_fp={first8}... hpke_key={first8}..."`.
     - **V3 attestation** (nonce present, GPU evidence available):
       - Recompute `expected = SHA-256(tls_fp || hpke_key || nonce || gpu_hash || nvswitch_hash)`.
       - Constant-time compare `expected` against `reportData[0:32]`.
       - Verify `reportData[32:64]` is all zeros.
       - Return detail string: `"v3: reportdata_hash verified, gpu_bound=true"`.
     - Detect V2 vs V3 by presence of GPU evidence in the raw attestation
       response. If the attestation JSON contains a `gpu` field, it is V3.
   - Note: In V2, client nonce is not verified in REPORTDATA. In V3, client
     nonce is part of the REPORTDATA hash. Set the `nonce_in_reportdata`
     factor accordingly.

3. **Tinfoil TDX Policy** (additional checks beyond `VerifyTDXQuote`):
   - After standard TDX verification, apply Tinfoil-specific policy:
     - Validate TD_ATTRIBUTES == `0x0000001000000000`.
     - Validate XFAM == `0xe702060000000000`.
     - Validate MR_SEAM is in the accepted set.
     - Validate MR_CONFIG_ID, MR_OWNER, MR_OWNER_CONFIG are all zeros.
     - Validate RTMR3 is all zeros.
     - Validate TEE_TCB_SVN >= minimum.
   - Store results as `tee_hardware_config` factor details in the report.

4. **MR_SEAM Whitelist** (initial values):
   ```
   TDX 2.0.08: 476a2997c62bccc78370913d0a80b956e3721b24272bc66c4d6307ced4be2865c40e26afac75f12df3425b03eb59ea7c
   TDX 1.5.16: 7bf063280e94fb051f5dd7b1fc59ce9aac42bb961df8d44b709c9b0ff87a7b4df648657ba6d1189589feab1d5a3c9a9d
   TDX 2.0.02: 685f891ea5c20e8fa27b151bf34bf3b50fbaf7143cc53662727cbdb167c0ad8385f1f6f3571539a91e104a1c96d75e04
   TDX 1.5.08: 49b66faa451d19ebbdbe89371b8daf2b65aa3984ec90110343e9e2eec116af08850fa20e3b1aa9a874d77a65380ee7e6
   ```
   These should go in `tinfoil/policy.go` as a hardcoded set, matching the
   pattern used for other provider measurement allowlists.

**Unit tests**:
- Test V2 document parsing with captured attestation responses (save a real
  response as testdata).
- Test V3 document parsing with captured nonce-based attestation (with GPU
  evidence).
- Test V2/V3 format detection (presence of `report_data` vs `body` field).
- Test decompression: valid gzip, truncated gzip, oversized gzip (>10 MiB).
- Test format rejection: unknown format URI.
- Test V2 REPORTDATA extraction: verify correct byte offsets (TLS FP + HPKE).
- Test V3 REPORTDATA verification: recompute SHA-256 hash, compare
  constant-time. Verify zeros in [32:64].
- Test V3 GPU evidence hash computation: SHA-256 of raw GPU JSON.
- Test MR_SEAM whitelist matching.

**Commit**: Phase 1 — Tinfoil attestation document parsing and TDX verification.

---

### Phase 2: Supply Chain Verification (Sigstore)

**Goal**: Verify Tinfoil code measurements via Sigstore DSSE bundles from
GitHub Releases.

**Files to create**:
- `internal/provider/tinfoil/sigstore.go` — Sigstore bundle fetching and
  verification
- `internal/provider/tinfoil/measurements.go` — Measurement comparison logic

**Implementation**:

1. **GitHub Release Fetcher**:
   - Fetch latest release tag from GitHub API (via `github-proxy.tinfoil.sh`
     or directly from `api.github.com`).
   - Fetch `tinfoil.hash` artifact from the release.
   - Fetch Sigstore attestation bundle from
     `repos/{repo}/attestations/sha256:{digest}`.

2. **Sigstore Bundle Verifier**:
   - Use `sigstore-go` library (same as used by teep's existing
     `attestation/sigstore.go`) to verify the DSSE bundle.
   - Certificate identity: OIDC issuer =
     `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`.
   - Workflow regex: `^https://github.com/{repo}/.github/workflows/.*@refs/tags/*`.
   - Require SCT, transparency log entry, observer timestamp.
   - Extract the in-toto predicate after verification.

3. **Code Measurement Extraction**:
   - Parse predicateType from the verified statement.
   - For `https://tinfoil.sh/predicate/snp-tdx-multiplatform/v1`:
     Extract `snp_measurement`, `tdx_measurement.rtmr1`,
     `tdx_measurement.rtmr2` as 3-register measurement.

4. **Hardware Measurement Fetcher** (TDX only):
   - Same GitHub + Sigstore flow, but for repo
     `tinfoilsh/hardware-measurements`.
   - Predicate type: `https://tinfoil.sh/predicate/hardware-measurements/v1`.
   - Extract list of `{id, mrtd, rtmr0}` entries.
   - Match enclave's MRTD (register 0) and RTMR0 (register 1) against entries.

5. **Measurement Comparison**:
   - Implement cross-platform comparison:
     - Multi-platform vs. TDX: compare RTMR1 and RTMR2; verify RTMR3 == 0.
     - Multi-platform vs. SEV-SNP: compare snp_measurement.
   - All comparisons constant-time.
   - Record code match as `sigstore_code_verified` factor.
   - Record hardware match as `cpu_id_registry` factor.

6. **Configuration Repo Mapping**:
   - Per-model Sigstore repo (from Tinfoil's published docs):
     - Chat router: `tinfoilsh/confidential-model-router`
     - Embeddings: `tinfoilsh/confidential-nomic-embed-text`
     - Audio (whisper): `tinfoilsh/confidential-audio-processing`
     - Audio (voxtral): `tinfoilsh/confidential-voxtral-small-24b`
     - Vision (qwen3-vl): `tinfoilsh/confidential-qwen3-vl-30b`
     - TTS (qwen3-tts): `tinfoilsh/confidential-qwen3-tts` (inferred)
   - Store this mapping in config or as defaults. The router handles model
     routing, so the proxy may only need to verify the router's attestation
     (which covers all models routed through it). Verify this during
     integration testing.

**Unit tests**:
- Test Sigstore bundle verification with a captured bundle (testdata).
- Test measurement extraction for multi-platform predicate.
- Test cross-platform comparison: TDX match, TDX mismatch, SEV-SNP match.
- Test hardware measurement matching: found, not found.
- Test RTMR3 zero validation.

**Commit**: Phase 2 — Tinfoil supply chain verification via Sigstore.

### Phase 3: SEV-SNP Attestation Verification

**Goal**: Support Tinfoil enclaves running on AMD SEV-SNP.

**Files to create**:
- `internal/attestation/sev.go` — SEV-SNP report parsing and verification
- `internal/attestation/sev_test.go` — Unit tests
- `internal/attestation/certs/genoa_cert_chain.pem` — AMD Genoa ARK+ASK certs

**Implementation**:

1. **Add `google/go-sev-guest` dependency** (analogous to `go-tdx-guest` for
   TDX).

2. **Parse SEV-SNP Report**:
   - Use `abi.ReportToProto()` to parse the binary report.
   - Extract: `Measurement` (48 bytes), `ReportData` (64 bytes), TCB
     version, guest policy.

3. **Verify SEV-SNP Attestation**:
   - Fetch VCEK certificate from AMD KDS (cache with filesystem caching).
   - Verify report signature against VCEK chain rooted at AMD Genoa ARK.
   - Validate guest policy (SMT=true, Debug=false, etc.).
   - Validate TCB minimums (BlSpl=0x07, TeeSpl=0x00, SnpSpl=0x0e,
     UcodeSpl=0x48).

4. **Return `SEVVerifyResult`**: analogous to `TDXVerifyResult`, with
   measurement, REPORTDATA, parse error, signature error, policy error.

5. **Integration into Tinfoil Attester**: In `FetchAttestation`, detect the
   format URI. For SEV-SNP, call the new SEV verifier instead of TDX.

**Unit tests**:
- Test SEV-SNP report parsing with captured attestation (testdata).
- Test VCEK chain validation.
- Test policy validation: valid, debug=true rejection, low TCB rejection.
- Test REPORTDATA extraction.

**Commit**: Phase 3 — AMD SEV-SNP attestation verification.

### Phase 4: EHBP E2EE Implementation

**Goal**: Implement the Encrypted HTTP Body Protocol for full-body request
encryption and response decryption.

**Files to create**:
- `internal/e2ee/ehbp.go` — EHBP client transport (encrypt request, decrypt
  response)
- `internal/e2ee/ehbp_test.go` — Unit tests
- `internal/provider/tinfoil/e2ee.go` — Tinfoil RequestEncryptor

**Go dependency**: Use `github.com/cloudflare/circl/hpke` or the standard
`crypto/hpke` (available in Go 1.24+) for HPKE operations.

**Implementation**:

1. **EHBP Encryption** (`ehbp.go`):
   - `EncryptRequest(body []byte, serverPubKey [32]byte) (encBody []byte, encapKey [32]byte, senderCtx, error)`:
     - Call HPKE `SetupBaseS` with X25519_HKDF_SHA256 / HKDF_SHA256 /
       AES_256_GCM and the server's public key.
     - Encrypt the body as a single chunk:
       `[4-byte len] [AES-256-GCM ciphertext]`.
       (Or stream multiple chunks if the body is large.)
     - Return the encrypted body bytes, the encapsulated key, and the
       retained HPKE sender context for response decryption.

2. **EHBP Decryption** (`ehbp.go`):
   - `DecryptResponse(encBody io.Reader, responseNonce [32]byte, encapKey [32]byte, senderCtx) ([]byte, error)`:
     - Export secret: `secret = senderCtx.Export("ehbp response", 32)`.
     - Construct salt: `salt = encapKey || responseNonce`.
     - Derive PRK: `prk = HKDF-Extract(salt, secret)`.
     - Derive key: `aead_key = HKDF-Expand(prk, "key", 32)`.
     - Derive nonce: `aead_nonce = HKDF-Expand(prk, "nonce", 12)`.
     - Read chunks: `[4-byte len] [ciphertext]`.
     - Decrypt each chunk with AES-256-GCM:
       nonce = `aead_nonce XOR chunk_index`.
     - On any auth failure: fail closed, return error immediately.

3. **Streaming Response Decryption**:
   - `DecryptResponseStream(body io.Reader, nonce, encapKey, ctx) (io.Reader, error)`:
     - Wraps response body in a reader that decrypts chunks on-the-fly.
     - Used for SSE streaming responses.
     - Each read returns one decrypted chunk.

4. **Tinfoil RequestEncryptor** (`tinfoil/e2ee.go`):
   - Implements `provider.RequestEncryptor`.
   - `EncryptRequest(body, raw, endpointPath)`:
     - Extract HPKE public key from raw attestation (REPORTDATA[32:64]).
     - Call `ehbp.EncryptRequest(body, pubKey)`.
     - Return encrypted body bytes and a Decryptor for the response.
   - Return a `Decryptor` that reads `Ehbp-Response-Nonce` from the response
     headers and calls `ehbp.DecryptResponse`.

5. **Proxy Integration**:
   - The existing proxy E2EE flow calls `Encryptor.EncryptRequest()` and then
     uses the returned Decryptor. The EHBP encryptor follows this same pattern.
   - Set `Ehbp-Encapsulated-Key` header on the outgoing request.
   - On response: read `Ehbp-Response-Nonce` header, pass to Decryptor.
   - If `Ehbp-Response-Nonce` is missing: fail closed.

**Unit tests**:
- Test encryption round-trip: encrypt with a test key, decrypt with known
  private key.
- Test chunked framing: single chunk, multiple chunks, zero-length chunks.
- Test response key derivation: verify against known test vectors (derive key
  from a known HPKE context and nonce, compare expected output).
- Test fail-closed: missing Ehbp-Response-Nonce, corrupted ciphertext.

**Commit**: Phase 4 — EHBP E2EE implementation.

---

### Phase 5: Provider Wiring and Configuration

**Goal**: Wire the Tinfoil provider into the proxy, config, and endpoint
dispatch.

**Files to modify**:
- `internal/proxy/proxy.go` — Add `case "tinfoil"` to `fromConfig()`
- `internal/config/config.go` — Add `TINFOIL_API_KEY` env resolution
- `teep.toml.example` — Add Tinfoil provider example
- `internal/defaults/defaults.go` — Add Tinfoil default allow-fail factors
- `docs/api_support.md` — Update endpoint and E2EE support matrices

**Implementation**:

1. **Config** (`config.go`):
   - Env var: `TINFOIL_API_KEY`.
   - Default base URL: `https://inference.tinfoil.sh`.
   - E2EE default: `true`.

2. **Provider Construction** (`proxy.go:fromConfig`):
   ```go
   case "tinfoil":
       p.ChatPath = "/v1/chat/completions"
       p.EmbeddingsPath = "/v1/embeddings"
       p.AudioPath = "/v1/audio/transcriptions"
       // TTS: /v1/audio/speech — add if proxy supports TTS endpoint
       p.Attester = tinfoil.NewAttester(cp.BaseURL, cp.APIKey, offline)
       p.Preparer = tinfoil.NewPreparer(cp.APIKey)
       p.ReportDataVerifier = tinfoil.ReportDataVerifier{}
       p.Encryptor = tinfoil.NewE2EE(cp.BaseURL, config.NewAttestationClient(offline))
       p.SupplyChainPolicy = nil // Sigstore-based, not compose-based
       p.ModelLister = provider.NewModelLister(cp.BaseURL, cp.APIKey, config.NewAttestationClient(offline))
   ```

3. **SPKI Caching**: Tinfoil uses a single inference gateway, so
   `SPKIDomainForModel` returns the base URL host for all models:
   ```go
   p.SPKIDomainForModel = func(_ context.Context, _ string) (string, bool) {
       return "inference.tinfoil.sh", true
   }
   ```

4. **TLS-Fingerprint-Bound Transport**: Create a `tinfoil.NewTransport()`
   that returns an `http.Transport` with `VerifyPeerCertificate` enforcing the
   attested SPKI fingerprint on every connection (see the TLS-Fingerprint-
   Bound Transport protocol section above). The transport is shared between
   the Attester, E2EE Encryptor, and inference request forwarding. On
   fingerprint mismatch during inference, trigger re-attestation before
   retrying.

5. **Allow-Fail Defaults**: Create `attestation.TinfoilDefaultAllowFail`
   with factors that may initially be advisory:
   - `sigstore_code_verified` — supply chain (non-blocking initially)
   - `cpu_id_registry` — hardware platform matching (non-blocking initially)
   - Standard NVIDIA factors that don't apply to Tinfoil

6. **TTS Endpoint**: If TTS (`/v1/audio/speech`) is not yet a proxy endpoint,
   add it to `proxy.go` following the pattern of other endpoints.

**Unit tests**:
- Test provider construction from config.
- Test SPKI domain resolution.
- Test that unknown Tinfoil config fields are rejected (strict TOML).

**Commit**: Phase 5 — Tinfoil provider wiring and configuration.

---

### Phase 6: Integration Tests

**Goal**: Full API-key-based integration tests for all Tinfoil endpoints.

**Files to create**:
- `internal/integration/tinfoil_test.go` — Integration tests
- `internal/integration/testdata/tinfoil/` — Captured attestation fixtures

**Tests** (all require `TINFOIL_API_KEY`):

1. **Attestation Fetch and Verify**:
   - Fetch attestation from `inference.tinfoil.sh`.
   - Verify TDX quote (or SEV-SNP depending on which platform serves).
   - Verify REPORTDATA binding.
   - Log all verification results.

2. **Supply Chain Verification**:
   - Fetch code measurements from `tinfoilsh/confidential-model-router`.
   - Verify Sigstore bundle.
   - Compare against enclave measurements.

3. **TLS Fingerprint Binding**:
   - Fetch attestation, extract TLS fingerprint.
   - Connect to enclave, extract TLS certificate fingerprint.
   - Verify match.

4. **Chat Completions (non-streaming)**:
   - Send a simple chat request through the proxy.
   - Verify response contains expected fields.
   - Verify request and response were E2EE encrypted/decrypted.

5. **Chat Completions (streaming)**:
   - Send a streaming chat request.
   - Verify SSE events are received and decrypted.

6. **Embeddings**:
   - Send an embedding request with model `nomic-embed-text`.
   - Verify response contains embedding vectors.
   - Verify E2EE.

7. **Audio Transcription**:
   - Send a multipart audio transcription request.
   - Verify response contains transcription text.
   - Verify E2EE (entire multipart body encrypted).

8. **TTS (text-to-speech)**:
   - Send a TTS request.
   - Verify response contains audio data.

9. **Models List**:
   - Send GET /v1/models.
   - Verify response contains expected model IDs.
   - Verify response is plaintext (EHBP does not encrypt GET responses).

10. **Vision (via chat completions)**:
    - Send a chat completion with image content array.
    - Verify response describes the image.

11. **Negative Tests**:
    - Verify that a request with a corrupted `Ehbp-Encapsulated-Key` is
      rejected by the server.
    - Verify that a response with a missing `Ehbp-Response-Nonce` is
      rejected by the proxy (fail closed).

**Fixture Tests** (offline, no API key):
- Capture a real attestation response and save as testdata.
- Test the full verification pipeline against the fixture.

**Commit**: Phase 6 — Tinfoil integration tests.

---

### Phase 7: Verification Report and Documentation

**Goal**: Update verification report generation and documentation.

**Files to modify**:
- `internal/attestation/report.go` — Add Tinfoil-specific verification
  factors
- `docs/api_support.md` — Add Tinfoil provider section
- `docs/measurement_allowlists.md` — Add Tinfoil MR_SEAM values

**Verification factor mapping** (reusing existing factors where possible):

Existing factors reused as-is:
- `tls_key_binding` — TLS fingerprint matches REPORTDATA
- `e2ee_capable` — HPKE key extracted from attestation (subsumes key binding)
- `e2ee_usable` — Request encrypted and response authenticated via EHBP

Existing factors proposed for TEE-generic rename (`tdx_*` → `tee_*`):
- `tee_quote_present` (was `tdx_quote_present`) — Hardware quote fetched
- `tee_quote_structure` (was `tdx_quote_structure`) — Quote parses correctly
- `tee_hardware_config` (was `tdx_hardware_config`) — Platform-specific policy
  (TDX: attributes, XFAM, MR_SEAM, RTMR3; SEV-SNP: guest policy, TCB)
- `tee_boot_config` (was `tdx_boot_config`) — Boot measurements match expected
- `tee_tcb_current` (was `tdx_tcb_current`) — TCB SVN meets minimum
- `intel_pcs_collateral` — Remains Intel-specific (TDX only); AMD equivalent
  covered by VCEK chain validation within `tee_quote_structure`

New cross-provider factors:
- `sigstore_code_verified` — Code measurement verified via Sigstore DSSE bundle
- `cpu_id_registry` — Hardware platform matched against Sigstore-attested
  registry (reuses existing factor name)

Existing factors with Tinfoil-specific behavior:
- `measured_model_weights` — Set to `Pass` when `sigstore_code_verified`
  passes, because the Sigstore chain transitively authenticates model weights
  via tinfoil-config.yml → dm-verity. Detail: "model weights attested via
  dm-verity commitment in Sigstore-verified config"
- `nonce_in_reportdata` — Set to advisory (not enforced). Tinfoil does not
  embed client nonces. Freshness from TLS key lifecycle. Detail: "tinfoil
  uses TLS key rotation for freshness, not client nonces"

**Documentation updates**:
- Add Tinfoil to the endpoint support matrix in `api_support.md`.
- Add Tinfoil E2EE details (EHBP, HPKE, full-body encryption).
- Document that Tinfoil has **no field-level encryption gaps** (full-body).

**Commit**: Phase 7 — Verification report factors and documentation.

## Verification Factors Summary

| Factor | Enforced | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `tee_quote_present` | Yes | Hardware quote fetched and non-empty |
| `tee_quote_structure` | Yes | Quote parses and signature verifies (TDX or SEV-SNP) |
| `tee_hardware_config` | Yes | Platform policy (TDX: attrs/XFAM/MR_SEAM/RTMR3; SEV-SNP: guest policy/TCB) |
| `tee_boot_config` | Yes | Boot measurements match expected (MRTD/RTMR0 or measurement) |
| `tee_tcb_current` | Yes | TCB SVN meets minimum threshold |
| `intel_pcs_collateral` | Yes (TDX only) | Intel collateral valid; N/A for SEV-SNP |
| `tls_key_binding` | Yes | TLS fingerprint matches REPORTDATA[0:32] |
| `e2ee_capable` | Yes | HPKE key extracted from attestation and verified |
| `e2ee_usable` | Yes | EHBP request encrypted + response AEAD-authenticated |
| `sigstore_code_verified` | Advisory initially | Code measurement verified via Sigstore DSSE |
| `cpu_id_registry` | Advisory initially | Hardware platform matched against registry |
| `measured_model_weights` | Yes (transitive) | Model weights attested via dm-verity + Sigstore chain |
| `nonce_in_reportdata` | Yes (V3) / Advisory (V2) | V3: client nonce in REPORTDATA hash; V2: TLS key lifecycle freshness |
| `cpu_gpu_chain` | Advisory initially | V3: GPU evidence hash in REPORTDATA; V2: Fail (no binding) |
| `nvidia_gpu_attestation` | Advisory initially | V3: SPDM evidence verified per GPU; V2: not available |

The `tee_*` factors are proposed renames of the existing `tdx_*` factors,
generalized to cover both Intel TDX and AMD SEV-SNP. This rename should be
applied across all providers (not just Tinfoil) as a prerequisite or
co-requisite refactoring step. Until the rename lands, Tinfoil can emit the
existing `tdx_*` factor names for TDX attestations and introduce `sev_*`
equivalents for SEV-SNP.

## Dependencies

New Go module dependencies:
- `github.com/google/go-sev-guest` — AMD SEV-SNP verification (Phase 3)
- `github.com/cloudflare/circl/hpke` or `crypto/hpke` (Go 1.24+) — HPKE
  operations for EHBP (Phase 4)
- `github.com/sigstore/sigstore-go` — Sigstore bundle verification (Phase 2;
  already a dependency via existing `attestation/sigstore.go`)

## Risk Assessment

1. **SEV-SNP is new attestation hardware for teep**: No existing SEV-SNP
   verification code. Phase 3 adds this. Can proceed with TDX-only initially
   since the router currently serves TDX attestation (as observed from live
   API).

2. **EHBP is a new E2EE protocol**: Unlike existing field-level or ML-KEM
   protocols, EHBP uses HPKE (RFC 9180). The protocol is well-specified with
   reference implementations in Go, JS, and Swift.

3. **V2 has no client nonces**: Tinfoil's V2 (legacy) attestation does not use
   client-supplied nonces in attestation. Freshness comes from the enclave's
   ephemeral TLS key (rotated on reboot). The V3 format supports client nonces
   and should be preferred. The proxy must re-attest on TLS certificate
   rotation (SPKI cache miss). The `nonce_in_reportdata` factor should be
   enforced for V3 and advisory for V2.

4. **Supply chain model differs**: Tinfoil uses Sigstore/GitHub Actions
   attestations rather than compose-hash/IMA. This is a stronger model (code
   measurement signed by transparent CI) but requires new verification code.

5. **Router architecture**: Tinfoil uses a confidential model router that
   handles multiple models. The attestation covers the router, not individual
   models. This is similar to nearcloud's gateway model. The router performs
   second-hop verification of each model enclave internally — teep trusts
   this because the router code is Sigstore-attested (see Authentication
   Chain 3 above).

6. **Model weight authentication is fully solved**: Unlike all existing teep
   providers, Tinfoil's model weights are cryptographically bound into the
   attestation chain via dm-verity + tinfoil-config.yml + Sigstore. The
   `measured_model_weights` factor can be set to `Pass` when the Sigstore
   supply chain verification succeeds (see Authentication Chain 4 above).
   This is a significant advantage over dstack providers where
   `measured_model_weights` always returns `Fail`.

7. **TEE.fail is unmitigated**: Tinfoil has no Proof of Cloud participation,
   no vTPM, and no DCEA. DDR5 memory bus key extraction attacks can forge
   TDX quotes with arbitrary measurements and REPORTDATA, defeating all
   software-layer security guarantees including Sigstore measurement
   matching and E2EE key binding. This is the same vulnerability affecting
   all TDX providers. The `cpu_id_registry` factor should be `Skip` for
   Tinfoil. See "Authentication Chain 5" for full analysis and the
   gpu_cpu_binding.md staged mitigation trajectory.

8. **GPU-CPU binding is partially available**: Tinfoil's V3 attestation
   binds GPU evidence into REPORTDATA (Option 2 from gpu_cpu_binding.md).
   This prevents GPU splicing attacks in the absence of TEE.fail. However,
   it does not defend against TEE.fail (the attacker can fabricate
   REPORTDATA including the GPU hash). The V2 format has no GPU binding.
   Teep should prefer V3 attestation and set `cpu_gpu_chain` accordingly.

9. **V3 attestation is not yet verified by any client**: The tinfoil-go
   library only verifies V2 attestation. Teep will be the first independent
   client to verify V3, including GPU evidence binding and REPORTDATA hash
   verification. Extra care is needed for test coverage.
