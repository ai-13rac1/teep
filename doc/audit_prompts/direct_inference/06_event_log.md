# Section 06 — Event Log Integrity & RTMR Replay

## Scope

Audit event-log parsing and replay integrity checks that recompute RTMR values and compare them with quoted RTMR evidence.

## Primary Files

- [`internal/attestation/eventlog.go`](../../../internal/attestation/eventlog.go)
- [`internal/attestation/report.go`](../../../internal/attestation/report.go)

## Required Checks

Verify and report replay algorithm details:
- hash algorithm used for extend operations (expected SHA-384 for TDX RTMRs),
- initial RTMR state (48 zero bytes),
- extend formula correctness: `RTMR_new = SHA-384(RTMR_old || digest)`,
- behavior for short digests (padding/normalization semantics),
- IMR index bounds validation (must stay within [0,3]),
- malformed-entry semantics (skip vs fail-whole-replay).

Also verify pre-replay behavior:
- whether malformed entries are silently dropped before replay,
- whether parser behavior can mask integrity failures.

You MUST define the check’s security boundary:
- event-log replay validates internal consistency of event-log-derived RTMR values with quoted RTMR values,
- replay alone does not prove software baseline approval,
- absence of MRTD/MRSEAM/RTMR baseline policy must be called out as a distinct residual risk.

## Section Deliverable

Provide:
1. findings-first list ordered by severity,
2. replay-algorithm correctness summary,
3. explicit malformed-input behavior classification,
4. include at least one concrete positive control and one concrete negative/residual-risk observation,
5. source citations for all claims.
